                        <p><b><a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.busterkeaton.org/" target="_blank">Joseph Frank
                                    Keaton</a></b> was born on October 4, 1895 in Piqua, Kansas, to Joe Keaton
                            and Myra Keaton. Joe and Myra were Vaudevillian comedians with a popular, ever-changing
                            variety
                            act,
                            giving Keaton an eclectic and interesting upbringing. In the earliest days on stage, they
                            traveled
                            with
                            a medicine show that included family friend, illusionist Harry Houdini. Keaton himself
                            verified
                            the
                            origin of his nickname "Buster", given to him by Houdini, when at the age of three, fell
                            down a
                            flight
                            of stairs and was picked up and dusted off by Houdini, who said to Keaton's father Joe, also
                            nearby,
                            that the fall was 'a buster'. Savvy showman Joe Keaton liked the nickname, which has stuck
                            for
                            more
                            than
                            100 years.
                            <br>
                            At the age of four, Keaton had already begun acting with his parents on the stage. Their act
                            soon
                            gained
                            the reputation as one of the roughest in the country, for their wild, physical antics on
                            stage.
                            It
                            was
                            normal for Joe to throw Buster around the stage, participate in elaborate, dangerous stunts
                            to
                            the
                            reverie of audiences. After several years on the Vaudeville circuit, "The Three Keatons",
                            toured
                            until
                            Keaton had to break up the act due to his father's increasing alcohol dependence, making him
                            a
                            show
                            business veteran by the age of 21.
